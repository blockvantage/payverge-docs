# Scanning QR Codes

Welcome! This guide shows you how to access restaurant menus and place orders using Payverge's QR code system. No app download required!

## What is a QR Code?

A QR code is a square barcode that you can scan with your phone's camera. At Payverge restaurants, each table has a unique QR code that gives you instant access to the menu.

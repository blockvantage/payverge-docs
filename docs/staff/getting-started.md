# Getting Started as Staff

Welcome to Payverge! This guide helps staff members get started with the platform. You don't need a crypto wallet or any blockchain knowledge - just your email address.

## How Staff Access Works

Unlike business owners who use crypto wallets, staff members use a simple email-based login system:

- **No Crypto Wallet Needed** - Just your email
- **No Passwords** - Use one-time codes instead
- **Role-Based Access** - See only what you need
- **Mobile Friendly** - Works on any device

## Receiving Your Invitation

### Invitation Email

Your manager will send you an invitation email:

**Email Contains:**
- Restaurant/business name
- Your assigned role
- Invitation link
- Expiration date (7 days)
